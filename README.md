# Nettle Basic

A simplified version of the Nettle risk engineering platform. This app allows risk engineers to manage clients, create assessments, upload evidence, and generate AI-powered risk reports.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenRouter API key

docker compose up --build
```
